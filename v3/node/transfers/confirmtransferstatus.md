# Confirm transfer status

To get the current status of a transfer, you would need to pass the transfer's unique `id` to our API endpoint to retrieve the updated status of that transfer. Here's a sample implementation to get the status of a processed transfer:

```javascript
var request = require("request");

var options = {
  method: "GET",
  url: "https://api.ravepay.co/v2/gpx/transfers",
  qs: {
    seckey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY",
    id: "YOUR_TRANSFER_ID",
    reference: "YOUR_TRANSFER_REFERENCE",
    q: "ACCOUNT_NAME_OR_ACCOUNT_NUMBER"
  },
  headers: { "content-type": "application/json" }
};

request(options, function(error, response, body) {
  if (error) throw new Error(error);

  console.log(body);
});
```

### Parameter definitions

The table below contains the definitions of the query parameters passed into the request above.

| Parameter   | Required | Description                                                                             |
| ----------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `seckey`    | True     | This is your merchant secret key, see how to get your API keys from your dashboard here |
| `id`        | True     | This is the transfer id, it can be gotten from the Initiate Transfer call as `data.id`  |
| `reference` | False    | This is the unique reference of the transfer generated by the merchant.                 |
| `q`         | False    | You can pass the full name or account_number returned in the Initiate Transfer call.    |

### Sample response

When the request parameters are supplied and the request is successful, you will get a response in the format below:

```json

  "status": "success",
  "message": "QUERIED-TRANSFERS",
  "data": {
    "page_info": {
      "total": 1,
      "current_page": 1,
      "total_pages": 1
    },
    "transfers": [
      {
        "id": 1094551,
        "account_number": "0058020310",
        "bank_code": "063",
        "fullname": "EKENE EZE",
        "date_created": "2020-01-23T14:17:43.000Z",
        "currency": "NGN",
        "debit_currency": null,
        "amount": 200,
        "fee": 45,
        "status": "SUCCESSFUL",
        "reference": "001122",
        "meta": null,
        "narration": "New transfer",
        "approver": null,
        "complete_message": "Transaction was successful",
        "requires_approval": 0,
        "is_approved": 1,
        "bank_name": "ACCESS BANK PLC (DIAMOND)"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Looking at the response object above, you can confirm that the transaction was successfully processed from the `complete_message` parameter.
